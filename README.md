# Compiler Generator
## Lexical Analyzer Generator [ First Phase ]

This phase of the project aims to practice techniques for building automatic
lexical analyzer generator tools.

#### Objective

Develop a suitable Syntax Directed Translation Scheme to convert Java code to Java bytecode, performing necessary lexical, syntax and static semantic analysis
(such as type checking and Expressions Evaluation).

#### Sample Runs

Images contain how the GUI were in the first phase of development.
Simple editor to lay rules/code in and a simple code analyzer UI to check lexemes results & transition table of the Minimized DFA
